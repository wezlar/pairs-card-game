# Pairs Card Game

This is a simple Pairs Card game that I am using to test my recently aquired React, Redux and Jest skills.

## Setup

This should be simple enough to install and start.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once started, the console should display the local URL in which it is running, which is normally [http://localhost:7770](http://localhost:7770)
